cgateweb
========
This repository is no longer maintained, I'd recommend grabbing a look at some of the forks which have added functionality and are probably more current, there's a couple linked below.

MQTT interface for C-Bus lighting written in Node.js

(If you're looking for HVAC, I haven't/can't try it but have a look at this fork: https://github.com/mminehanNZ/cgateweb)

(If you're using this with Home Assistant, this fork has added some useful features: https://github.com/dougrathbone/cgateweb)

### Install:
(for raspberry pi)
```
cd /usr/local/bin
sudo git clone https://github.com/the1laz/cgateweb.git
cd cgateweb
npm install
sudo nano settings.js
```
Put in your settings.
```
sudo cp cgateweb.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl start cgateweb
sudo systemctl enable cgateweb
```
### Usage if not using as service:

1) Put your settings in settings.js
2) Run node index.js

Detailed guides and supporting articles will be posted on my blog: https://blog.addictedtopi.com/category/project/cbus/

### Updates get published on these topics:

 - cbus/read/#1/#2/#3/state  -  ON/OFF gets published to these topics if the light is turned on/off

 - cbus/read/#!/#2/#3/level  -  The level of the light gets published to these topics

### Publish to these topics to control the lights:

 - cbus/write/#1/#2/#3/switch  -  Publish ON/OFF to these topics to turn lights on/off

 - cbus/write/#1/#2/#3/ramp  -  Publish a % to ramp to that %. Optionally add a comma then a time (e.g. 50,4s or 100,2m). Also, INCREASE/DECREASE ramp by 5% up or down and ON/OFF turns on/off.

### This requests an update from all lights:

 - cbus/write/#1/#2//getall - current values get published on the cbus/read topics

 #1,#2 and #3 should be replaced by your c-bus network number, application number, and the group number.

Requesting an update on start or periodic updates can be set in the settings file.

### This requests the network tree:

 - cbus/write/#1///gettree - result gets published as JSON on cbus/read/#1///tree

### Other notes:
I made this for working with OpenHAB
It assumes the default cgate ports
